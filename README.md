- **Key Concepts**: Probability estimation, decision-making under uncertainty.

### 2. Programming Assignment 2: Tetris

- **Objective**: Create an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning with Neural Networks to play Tetris.
- **Agent Design**: Implement a Q-learning-based agent using neural networks to estimate the q-values for each game state.
- **Key Concepts**: Reinforcement learning, neural networks, function approximation.

### 3. Lab 2: Stealth with Graph Traversals

- **Objective**: Use BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra-based algorithms to guide an agent through a maze to destroy an enemy base.
